            <h1>Why should you, as a designer, make accessibility part of your design process?</h1>
            
            <p>Did you know that around <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2021/disabilities-act.html#:~:text=41.1%20million%20or%2012.7%25,the%20United%20States%20in%202019.">12.7% of the US population</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health#:~:text=An%20estimated%201.3%20billion%20people%20%E2%80%93%20or%2016%25%20of%20the%20global,experience%20a%20significant%20disability%20today.">16% of the global population</a> identifies with having a
            disability? That's no small number! So, as a designer, why not make accessibility an integral part of your design
            process? Not only does it open up your creations to a wider audience, but it also enhances the overall user experience
            for everyone.<br><br>
            
            Think about it: when you create accessible designs, you're actually making the web a better place for everyone.
            Accessibility improves usability, making websites more convenient and enjoyable to use, regardless of individual
            abilities. "But wait," you might wonder, "Won't designing for accessibility limit my creativity?" Not at all! In fact, it's quite
            the opposite. Accessibility guidelines and best practices act as helpful tools rather than stifling constraints. They
            encourage you to find innovative solutions and think outside the box. Picture it as a colorful palette of possibilities,
            allowing you to create enchanting experiences that captivate users from all walks of life.<br><br>
            
            "Wouldn't it costme a lot of time and effort to create accessible designs", you might also ask. Quite the opposite! Integrating accessibility into your design process doesn't have to cost you extra time. By considering
            accessibility from the start, you naturally weave it into your design framework. It becomes an organic part of your
            creative journey, rather than a separate and time-consuming task. And that's why I am introducing handing this respource to you; hoping that I can make it easier for you to incorporate accessibility in your design process. Think of this as your trusty companion, accompanying you
            throughout the design process, and making sure you design useful, usable, and accessible interfaces. <br><br>

            <h1>Now that we have established that it’s important to think about accessibility…</h1>
            <p>Let's dive deeper into the different experiences that users have on the web, and what creating an accessible experience means.
                Accessibility is not just about providing alternative text for images; it encompasses a multitude of considerations that ensure a truly inclusive web experience for everyone. <br><br>
                When it comes to navigating the web, various accessibility issues come into play, catering to different needs and
                abilities. Let's explore some of the key dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="part2-list"><a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/what-is-cognitive-accessibility#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Ccognitive%20accessibility%22%20refers,affect%20how%20they%20process%20information." class="in-text-link">Cognitive Accessibility</a>: Designing with cognitive accessibility in mind involves organizing content logically, using clear language, and
                providing helpful cues and signposts along the way.</il>

                <li class="part2-list"><a href="https://accessibility.digital.gov/visual-design/getting-started/#:~:text=Accessibility%20for%20visual%20designers&text=People%20with%20different%20visual%20abilities,a%20website's%20information%20and%20functionality."
                        class="in-text-link">Visual Accessibility</a>: Incorporating proper color contrast, descriptive image captions, scalable fonts, and adaptable layouts to ensure that
                        your design resonates with everyone, no matter their visual abilities.</il>

                <li class="part2-list"><a
                        href="https://adasitecompliance.com/website-accessibility-for-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/"
                        class="in-text-link">Auditory Accessibility</a>: Catering to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Including closed captions, transcripts, and alternative audio
                        descriptions for multimedia elements lets every user embrace the full spectrum of your content.</il>

                <li class="part2-list"><a href="https://webaim.org/articles/motor/"
                        class="in-text-link">Motor Accessibility</a>: Addressing the needs of those with physical disabilities, ensuring they can navigate and interact
                        with web interfaces comfortably. Designing with motor accessibility in mind involves providing keyboard navigation
                        options, allowing sufficient time for interactions, and avoiding elements that rely solely on precise mouse movements.</il>

                <li class="part2-list"><a href="https://bestwebsiteaccessibility.com/guides/web-accessibility-for-users-with-speech-disabilities/" class="in-text-link">Speech Accessibility</a>:
                    Accommodating individuals with speech impairments, allowing them to engage with the web through alternative input methods.</il>
            </ul>
            <p>As a designer, it's important to center your designs around your user needs, weaving together different cognitive, visual, auditory, motor, and speech elements. Before we jump into what you should do, it's important to understand how different users can experience the same website in a very different way. For example, I used a tool called Toptal to see how users with achromatopsia (a type of color blindness) see Amazon's website.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph-part">See how drastically different it can be? This is why guidleines like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG) exist to enable developers and designers to create a just and accessible experience for all. I compiled all those different guidlines into a list that you, my fellow designer, can use to guide your deisgn process. Excited to see the great designs you create!</p>

                <p>It's important to organize the information on the page in a way that will make it easy for users to naviagte and understand, esepcially 
                    users who utilize screen readers. Here is a video illustrating how it's like to navigate a webpage with a screen reader:</p>

                    </li>
                    <p class="bullet-subtext">
                        Screen readers usually start by reading the <b class="bold">page's headings</b>, starting from the highest-level
                        heading and moving down to lower-level headings. Those different sections or "roles" are specified in code using what are called tags. For example, the headings that would be read first will have the following tag: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and the second one will have: <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>... and it goes on till 6. This becomes relevant for you as a designer when communicating your designs to developers<br><br>
                        Headings provide an outline of the content structure. Next, screen readers typically read the <b
                            class="bold">links</b> on the page. <br><br>
                        Screen readers then move on to reading <b class="bold">form controls</b>, such as input fields, checkboxes,
                        radio buttons, and dropdown menus. After going through the structural elements, screen readers read the main
                        content of the page, including <b class="bold">paragraphs, sentences, and individual text elements</b>.

                    <div class="bullet-subtext">
                        <p>In terms of code, developers can distinguish this hierarchy of information using what is called a tag:</p>
                        <code>
                            <p>For headings: <span class="tag">&lt;h1&gt;</span>, <span class="tag">&lt;h2&gt;</span>, ... up to <span class="tag">&lt;h6&gt;</span></p>

                        </code>
                        <p>It's important to clearly communicate the roles that different bodies of text take on the page to ensure an
                            accessible implementation. You can read more about <a

                        It's recommended a target size of at least 44 x 44 pixels to ensure that it's easy to interact with, especially for
                        users with physical disabilities.</p>

                    It's important to think about how to indicate those states to show the users when they are interacting with the button. Those states can be translated to code through properties like <code><span>:focus, :hover, :active</span></code></p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Here is an example of how to add an in-text link:</p>
                <code><span class="tag">&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</span></code><br>
                <p>The "a" tag (wait, <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/html-tags">what is a tag?</a>) is used for creating links, just like what the heading tags we discussed earlier are used to create different heading effects. The actual link goes into the "href" attribute of the tag, while the text you want to be displayed is between the two tag arrows.</p>
                <p>The code above renders on the screen as following:</p>
                <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <label class="check-container" for="item14"><input type="checkbox" id="item14">
                            <span class="checkmark"></span>Use meaningful text to describe links</label>
                    </li>
                    <p class="bullet-subtext">
                        You want to properly set the user's expectations of where this link is going to take them by using meaningful and concise text, just like we used "Google" in the example.</p>
                
                    <li>
                        <label class="check-container" for="item15"><input type="checkbox" id="item15">
                            <span class="checkmark"></span>Provide clear visual indications for links</label>
                    </li>
                    <p class="bullet-subtext">The default browser settings makes links underlined and in a blue color. Those properties are adjustable through code, but make sure that you specify how you want to indicate links in your hand-off to developers.</p>

                    <li>
                        <label class="check-container" for="item16"><input type="checkbox" id="item16">
                            <span class="checkmark"></span>Consider link transition</label>
                    </li>
                    <p class="bullet-subtext">What happens when I click the link? Does it open in a new tab or in the same tab? Does it open a modal? Those are properties that can be specified in code. Make sure you think about this interaction and specify it in your design.</p>
